# Improve model

Improve model by iterating with hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, ensembles, and use different models for different subsets of the dataset.

## Best practices

Typically, you’d improve the model in this pipeline until you’ve reached a plateau or an acceptable model performance.

However, only for this demonstration project we’ll improve the model in the retraining pipeline instead of this training pipeline.
