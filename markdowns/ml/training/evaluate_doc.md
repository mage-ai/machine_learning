# Evaluate

[Identify relevant model performance metrics](https://www.mage.ai/blog/definitive-guide-to-accuracy-precision-recall-for-product-developers).

This is a classification problem so we’ll use these metrics:

1. Accuracy
1. Precision
1. Recall

Identify relevant model performance metrics. Evaluate performance metrics on test set. Use cross-validation, compare against baseline or simpler models, constant guess, randomly guessing an outcome (e.g. a coin flip is 50% correct), mode guess, etc.

We’ll the performance against simpler models:

1. Compare against SVM
1. Compare against logistic regression

We’ll also compare the metrics against baseline metrics:

1. Constant guess
1. Random guess
1. Mode guess
