## What

Deploy the trained model to a production environment to generate predictions on new data, either in real-time via an API or in batch pipelines. Integrate the model's predictions with other business applications.

## Why

A model only delivers business value when its predictions are surfaced to end users and integrated into decision-making processes and products. Deployment makes the model accessible and usable.


## How

1. [Serialize and containerize model](https://www.mage.ai/blog/guide-to-model-training-save-and-load) for portability.
2. Set up feature fetching pipelines.
3. Deploy model for real-time inference via API or offline batch predictions.
4. Integrate model predictions into applications, reports, products, etc.
