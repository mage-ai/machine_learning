# Problem

Planeswalker sends regular emails to users, but is experiencing a high unsubscribe rate. The hypothesis is that generic, irrelevant emails are causing users to opt out.

To reduce unsubscribes, Planeswalker should personalize email content for each user based on their app profile data. By predicting and including the most relevant content for a specific user, the emails will be more engaging.

# Hypothesis

Personalized emails tailored to each user's interests will make the content more valuable to them. This should decrease the number of people unsubscribing compared to generic mass emails.

The key is using individual user data to determine the optimal content to include in each email. Sending highly targeted, customized emails is likely to improve relevance and reduce unsubscribes.
