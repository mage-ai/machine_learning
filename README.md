# 🕵️‍♀️ Define problem

Clearly state the business problem you're trying to solve with machine learning and your hypothesis for how it can be solved.

<br />

# 💾 Prepare data

Collect data from various sources, generate additional training data if needed, and
perform feature engineering to transform the raw data into a set of useful input features.

<br />

# 🦾 Train and evaluate

Use the training data to teach the machine learning model to make accurate predictions.
Evaluate the trained model's performance on a test set.

<br />

# 🤖 Deploy and integrate

Deploy the trained model to a production environment to generate predictions on new data,
either in real-time via an API or in batch pipelines.
Integrate the model's predictions with other business applications.

<br />

# 🔭 Observe

Monitor the deployed model's prediction performance, latency, and system health in the production environment.

/>

<br />

# 🧪 Experiment

Conduct controlled experiments like A/B tests to measure the impact of the model's predictions on
business metrics. Compare the new model's performance to a control model or previous model versions.

<br />

# 🏋️ Retrain

Continuously gather new training data and retrain the model periodically to maintain and
improve prediction performance.
